# CAPSTONE PROJECT

Just run npm install to install dependencies, and npm start, to start the project.

## Folders

* Item bin: used to start project
* Item middleware: used to ckeck if we are logged in or not
* Item Models: used to create User model
* Item routes: used to create all the routes used in this project (projects, api, login, logout...)
* Item src: used for my 'recipes' project
* Item test: use mocha and chai to test the api. Use 'mocha --timeout=15000' if errors are found, because fetching data from others websites may be slow
* Item views: used to display data on the screen. The 'h_' before each view means that this come from the main website. Other, means that this come from my differents projects.
